## Roadmap

- [ ] Selective translation based on tokenized parts of speech.
- [ ] Basic translation into most probable meaning of word (maybe based on )
- [ ] Using actual tranlation engine to translate words with multiple possible meanings based on the context of the sentence (e.g. words with multiple meanings, words written only as kana).
